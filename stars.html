                    I have always preferred arts over mainstream academics. However, had no idea of what to do and how to do it, so I ended up getting degree. That didnt stop me from my interest in arts, when I pursued my interest in arts as a hobby, thats when I came to know I can make money from doing what I love! 
                    This happened during the course of lockdown, where there was abundant amount of time but no possible way of selling them, thats when the online shopping was in boom,a ray of hope bloomed and still standing for people like me who dont have enough time to go out and market what we create.
